      Hello, ${ user }.
      This is your Legal Aid Help.
      
      You qualify for Legal Aid:
      
      ${ poor_aid }
      % if poor_aid:
      Congratulations, you have qualified for Legal Aid!
      
      % else:
      Unfortunately, you do not qualify for legal aid.
      
      % endif
      
      % if len(Family) > 0:
      You stated that you live with: ${ Family }.
      
      % for r in Family:
      
      ${ r } sounds like they may also qualify for Legal Aid.
      
      % endfor
      
      I'm a particularly big fan of ${ Family[0] }.
      
      % else:
      You are a lonely human, so we will try our best to help you. I suggest buying a pet!
      % endif
      
      You told me you were born on ${ format_date(birthday, format='EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy') }, which can also be written as ${ format_date(birthday, format="yyy-MM-dd") }
